🔍 Attrition is a challenge organizations face today, and I've been diving deep into our data to uncover valuable insights. Thanks to the guidance of my mentor, Rishabh Mishra, I've created an interactive Power BI dashboard that sheds light on the factors driving attrition in  organization.

👩‍💼 Most Impacted Job Roles: Identifying the roles with the highest attrition rates is the first step to retaining our top talent.

💰 Attrition based on Salary Range: Is compensation a key driver? The data has some answers.

📆 Vintage of the Leaving Employee: How long have they been with us? It's time to focus on employee longevity.

😊 Attrition by Job Role Satisfaction: Happy employees stay longer. Let's work on improving job satisfaction!

🙌 I'm excited to share this journey of data-driven decision-making. It's not just about numbers; it's about understanding our people better and making positive changes.
